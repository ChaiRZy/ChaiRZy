### 🔥 What am I working on lately?

- 🦀 **openClaw** deep player — it’s my token! burning funds every day 💸
- 🤖 **Local large models** trouble-shooter — one context run nearly smoked my machine 💥
- ⚡ **AI-driven development** practitioner — 60% of code written by AI; I handle the "directions" and clean up the mess

---

### 🧠 My crude understanding of AI

- **MCP**: Gives AI a **hand** — lets it touch external data and tools  
- **RAG**: Gives AI a **short-term memory brain** — open-book exams, reject hallucinations  
- **Agent**: Gives AI a **planning brain** — knows what to do first and next  
- **Skill**: Gives AI a **pipeline muscle** — atomic operations, aim and execute

❓ What is still needed to replace humans?  
**Creativity** and **autonomy** — the last strongholds of humanity, and my final stubbornness 😏

### ⚡ Geek creed

> “Worrying about being replaced by AI while wildly tempting fate”  
> Code never dies, tinkering never stops 🚀
